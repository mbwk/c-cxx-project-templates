C++ Tup Project Template
========================

Initialize a tup project:

    $ tup init
    $ tup


Make changes, compile changes, run executable:

    $ $EDITOR src/main.cpp
    $ tup
    $ ./example


Take Note:
----------

This is only a very basic example of using tup.  It is actually much more powerful
than this example project might imply.

This basic example exists simply to showcase how much simpler it is to use tup over
traditional Makefiles without resorting to heavyweight abstractions like CMake.
